        <h2>Sampaguita Ice Cream</h2>
        <p>This Filipino inspired ice cream shop offers a wide variety of deliciously unique flavors! It has numerous vegan options and they make their ice cream in-house. You can also find fun things like Halo Halo, Bananacue, and Ube Brownie Sundaes on their menu. I highly recommend trying their Ube sauce!</p>

        <h2>Koi Sushi</h2>
        <p>This Japanese restaurant has the best sushi I've had in Orlando hands down, and some of the best sushi I've had in general! You can tell that their ingredients are incredibly fresh and high quality. If you're a sushi lover, this place is a must. My favorite roll of theirs is the Lover Tuna Roll!</p>

        <h2>Infusion Tea</h2>
        <p>This tea spot is perfect for brunch with friends! Their tea menu is impressive and the atmosphere is quaint and cozy. Their Earl Grey Cream tea always tastes delicious and they make the best avocado toast I've ever had. Additionally, they offer a service where you can share a pot of tea and 3-tier pastry tray with a friend!</p>
